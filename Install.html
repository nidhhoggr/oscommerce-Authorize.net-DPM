Install Guide</h1></center>
This is tested as of June 20, 2012 on both osCommerce Online Merchant v2.2 Release Candidate 2a and the latest version of Authorize.net as seen at: http://developer.authorize.net/api/dpm/<br>
<br>
The first thing to say is that this is not the Standard AuthorizeNet payment module.&nbsp;

That's all there is to installing the files<br>
<br>
&nbsp;
<U><B>Set Up</B></U><br>
Once you've installed the new files and applied the edits to two other files go to your osCommerce
'admin' panel, go to Modules --&gt; Payment, click
once on the Authorize
Net AIM link, and then click to Install.<br>
<br>
When you've done that,
click on 'Edit' and set up as follows:<br>
1.&nbsp; <B>Enable
Authorize.net AIM Module</B> - Set to 'True'<br>
2.&nbsp; <B>Login User
Name</B> as provided to you by AuthorizeNet<br>
3.&nbsp; <B>The
Transaction Key</B> provided to you by AuthorizeNet,
which you can also
re-generate (create new) in your
AuthorizeNet control
panel.<br>
4.&nbsp; <B>Transaction
Mode </B>is initially Test.&nbsp; The module will
automatically switch
the type of data it sends, but not the
url it connects to when you
change this setting to Live
&nbsp;- but your AuthorizeNet
account also has to be switched to Live mode.<br>
5.&nbsp; <B>Authorization
Type</B> - recommended setting is
Authorize/Capture<br>
6.&nbsp; <B>Customer
Notifications</B> - recommended setting
is False.&nbsp; If all
works properly they will already receive
an Order Confirmation
from your website.<br>
7.&nbsp; <B>Merchant
Notifications</B> - recommended setting
is True.&nbsp; If all
works properly you'll get a copy of the
Order Confirmation
email and this confirmation.&nbsp; If
all does not work
properly at least you should get this
confirmation of what
was ordered and by whom!<br />8.&nbsp; <B>Request CVV Number</B> -
  recommended setting is True<br>
  9.&nbsp; <B>Sort Order
    Of Display</B> - set to zero to make this module
  appear above other
  payment modules.<br>
  10. <B>Payment Zone</B>
  - if you enable this then only payments
  within the selected
  zone will be approved.<br>
  11. <B>Set Order Status</B>
  - leave set to Default or set to
  an order status of your
  choice.<br>
  12. <B>CURL Proxy IP Address</B> -
  If your provider requires the use of a CURL proxy, enter the full URL
  here, otherwise leave it set to none.<br>
  13.&nbsp; Click <B>Update</B>
  and you're done installing here.<br>
  <br>
  
</p>
<center><U><B>Additional Info</B></U></center>
<p>  Please refer to the documentation provided to you by AuthorizeNet on how to set up your
account interface with them.&nbsp; It cannot be covered here.<br>
<br>
Run adequate testing
<B>before</B> you put your account <B>Live</B> with AuthorizeNet.<br>
<br>
If you have used
previous versions of Authorize Net AIM on osCommerce you will notice
some differences:<br>
<br>
(a).&nbsp; The cvv
popup now works.<br>
<br>
(b).&nbsp; There is no
entry to store information in the database.  
People were
confused by the instruction to add a table to the database, which was
unnecessary as much of
the data is already stored there in the 'orders' table.&nbsp; We considered providing an additional .sql file which people could use
to set up an extra
table to capture response codes etc. but decided against it.&nbsp;
Many osCommerce Users do not know how to set up an
additional sql table
and find altering the database intimidating.<br>
<br>
(c).&nbsp; There is no
entry to store credit card details in the database.&nbsp; This was
completely unnecessary as the card details are stored in the 'orders'
table.
The card details are
stored unencrypted, so please make sure that your site is secure - <B>YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE</B> for the security of that information!<br>
<br>
(d)&nbsp; If you have
an existing Authorize Net account and have been using it in <B>SIM</B>
mode then don't forget to reset it to <B>AIM (3.1)</B> mode.&nbsp;
Set the below as
follows:<br>
<br>
i.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Delimited Response = No<br>
ii.&nbsp; Default Field
Seperator = comma<br>
iii. Field
Encapsulation Character = blank<br>
<br>
(e)&nbsp; If you have
problems establishing a connection to Authorize Net whilst running in
Test mode then, on line 301 of
catalog/includes/modules/authorizenet_aim.php,
change the url to the
following: $url =
'https://certification.authorize.net/gateway/transact.dll';</p>
<p>(f) The error for &quot;<em>Your credit card</em> could not be authorized for this <em>reason</em>&quot; has been fixed.<br>
  <br>
  <B>This
    Contribution is provided on an 'as is' basis.&nbsp; We make no
    guarantee that it will work on your website, and accept no
    responsibility if you decide</B> <B>to
      install it on your website.</B> Most of the credit for
  this module goes to the original osCommerce Team who wrote the
  Authorize Net payment module, which was then adapted for
  the Authorize Net AIM
service by Jason LeBaron.&nbsp;Other credit goes to dynamoeffects who updated this until 2008 and Vger who wrote the addon originally in 2006. </p>
